# Standards Addressed

## 1. Basic Digital Tool Fluency

Students are required to navigate the filesystem, manipulate files and directories.
This will hopefully lead and encourage them to actively use the terminal more and practice so that they can eventually move quickly through it.

## 2. Systems and Software Understanding

By using the terminal to interact with the file system and configure shell behavior (via `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`), students will show a concrete understanding of how the software layers interact at the system level.

## 3. Automation and Abstraction

Students write a basic alias to automate directory navigation.
This small but practical example introduces the concept of abstraction: using a short name (`gotowork`) to represent a longer command.
It also introduces automation as a benefit of customizing computing environments.

## 4. Problem Solving and Workflow Design

Students follow a multi-step process to create a structured workspace.
They demonstrate sequential thinking and problem-solving when interpreting command behavior and troubleshooting issues.
